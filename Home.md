Is a mostly [RESTful](https://ics.uci.edu/~fielding/pubs/dissertation/rest_arch_style.htm) framework for control systems developed by [Project 8](http://www.project8.org).
It comprises two components:  

1. A [[Wire Protocol|Wire-Protocol]] which defines the structure of valid messages
2. A [[Set of Conventions|Conventions]] which are standardized behaviors based on messages sent using that wire protocol
